# Quiz 1

## Overview
In Quiz 1, we had to debug on why the function doesn't work correctly. There were 2 issues found in total and when working in a reverse method the goal is to change the start and end as it follows. Troubleshooting, I saw that I needed to change the iteration in the loop.

# Quiz 2

## Overview
In Quiz 2, we had to figure out how to compile a working source file. By bringing it together as one unit it'll be able to work globally. Troubleshooting, learning that we have to import and export we specifically used 'extern' to reference back to our main file.
